# Simple Todo App

A simple and easy to use website where you can write things that need to be done, and then check a box once you've completed a task.

## Functionality

The website, using JavaScript, allows you to input a task and a date into a form that will then display the task and date on the website, allowing you to check a box indicating whether you've completed the task or not.

## Technology

Using Import and Export functionality, the code is organized in a way so that the website doesn't have any unneccesary fluff. This allows for the website to appear simple and be accesible.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
